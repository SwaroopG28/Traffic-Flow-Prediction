**# Traffic Flow Prediction**  

This project predicts traffic flow using historical data on vehicle counts (cars, bikes, buses, trucks), time, and day of the week. The goal is to analyze patterns, forecast traffic situations, and offer insights to manage congestion, optimize traffic control, and reduce emissions for better urban mobility.

**## Data Dictionary**  
The dataset includes:  
- **Time:** Timestamp of observation  
- **Date:** Date of observation  
- **Day of the Week:** Day corresponding to the observation  
- **CarCount:** Count of cars  
- **BikeCount:** Count of bikes  
- **BusCount:** Count of buses  
- **TruckCount:** Count of trucks  
- **Total:** Total vehicle count  
- **Traffic Situation:** Categorized traffic condition (e.g., congestion level)

**## Data Preprocessing**  
1. **Time & Date Formatting:** Converted to datetime; new features like Hour, Month, and Day were extracted.  
2. **Categorical Data Handling:** Encoded Day of the Week and Traffic Situation for modeling.  
3. **Missing Values:** Replaced with column medians.

**## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
Key findings:  
- **Peak Hours:** Rush hours see spikes in car and bike counts; bus/truck counts are stable.  
- **Vehicle Types:** Cars dominate traffic; trucks have the lowest volume.  
- **Traffic Situations:** Higher truck counts worsen traffic conditions.  
- **Day Variability:** Total traffic remains steady, with slight variations in vehicle type distributions.

**## Model Building and Evaluation**  
- **Model:** Random Forest Classifier  
- **Performance:** Accurately predicted high-traffic periods, aiding traffic management.  
- **Metrics:**  
  - Confusion Matrix: Analyzed prediction accuracy.  
  - Classification Report: Detailed precision, recall, and F1-scores.  
  - Accuracy: Achieved satisfactory levels.  

**Important Features:**  
1. CarCount  
2. BikeCount  
3. Day of the Week  
4. Hour of the Day  

**Visual Insights:**  
- Traffic peaks: Cars/bikes dominate during rush hours; trucks remain steady.  
- Day-wise patterns: Unique distributions for vehicle types across the week.  
- Correlations: CarCount and BikeCount are positively correlated; TruckCount negatively impacts traffic conditions.

**## Conclusion**  
This project demonstrates how vehicle counts, time, and day impact traffic patterns. It supports city planners by enabling dynamic traffic management, optimizing signal timings, and scheduling public transport efficiently. These insights help minimize congestion, reduce emissions, and promote sustainable urban mobility.  

The model's predictions contribute to smarter cities with better road networks, less time spent in traffic, and a reduced environmental footprint, enhancing overall transportation systems.
